Executive Summary
This analysis of  the Used Vehicle dataset aimed to identify key drivers that influence price, using various car attributes. 

Model Performance:
Lasso Regression turned out to be slightly better but all models effectively performed the same. Linear and Lasso Regression performed almost identically , with Lasso having the lease MAE and matching the best R square score. Ridge Regression slightly underperformed in all metrics compared to the others. However the difference was very minor hence statistically all three models performed similarly.

Key Drivers:
The most crucial factors for driving Price were identified as Manufacturer and Odometer by Linear and Ridge Regression. Lasso additionally identified Car Age as a key attribute that drove prices. Luxury Vehicles with Manufacturers like Aston Martin , Ferrari, Tesla , Porsche drove inventory will have drive used vehicles prices higher and lower end vehicles like Fiat, Mitsubishi, Kia ,and Nissan will not achieve much higher prices/gains. The Odometer , followed by Car Age have an inverse relationship with Price.
